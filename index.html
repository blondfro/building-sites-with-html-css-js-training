            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                For many years, <b>Bethany</b> has been baking the most delicious pies at
                her home.
                In 2013, we opened our first store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street
                near the Grand Market. People from all over the world fell in love with the soft
                cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies...
                The store became a success in no time.

                <br>
                <br>
                In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved
                into a larger building. After receiving many requests, it became clear that our
                next step was making it possible to order pies from the comfort of your own home
                and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result of this: our very
                own webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you
                feel like it!
            </p>
            <p>
                Bethany is famous for using only the best ingredients. This way, we can make sure
                that our pies are absolutely the best.
